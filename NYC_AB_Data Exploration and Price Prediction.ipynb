The information can be grouped into four distinct categories given by:\n\nHost descriptors:\n\n - host_id: host id\n - host_name: name of the host\n - calculated_host_listings_count: amount of listing per host\n\nListing descriptors:\n\n - id: listing ID\n - name: name of the listing\n - room_type: listing space type\n - minimum_nights: amount of nights minimum\n - availability_365: number of days when listing is available for booking\n - price: price in dollars\n\nReview descriptors:\n\n - number_of_reviews: number of reviews\n - last_review: latest review\n - reviews_per_month: number of reviews per month\n\nLocation descriptors:\n\n - neighbourhood_group: location\n - neighbourhood: area\n - latitude: latitude coordinates\n - longitude: longitude coordinates\n\nAs for any econometric analysis, diving cluelessly into regression analysis without examining the dataset and clarifying the objective first does not yield suitable results. Preprocessing the data in accordance with the goal to predict the price of the listings is the first step. In order to reduce the heterogeneity in the dataset, the following analysis focusses on offerings for short-term rentals (e.g. visitors to the city) with 30 minimum nights at most.\n\nBased on this limitation factors that potentially influence the listing's price include but are not limited to :\n\n - neighbourhood\n - proximity to relevant infrastructure (e.g. subway) and landmarks\n - quality of the listing\n - reviews\n - type of listing (e.g. shared/ individual room)\n\nWhile these factors are included in the basic dataset, other important characteristics are not consideres in this file. Hence, we utilized additional data sources and own calculations to enhance the analysis. Variables created with new datasets are the following:\n - minimum distance to the next subway station\n - minimum distance to the next popular landmarks\n - is the host a 'superhost'\n - can the listing can be referred to as 'premium'\n - review scores\n - is the host verified\n - property type\n\nThe remainder is structured as follows. First, we import all required packages and scan the data for outliers that would significantly impair the result of the prediction. In a second step, the visualization of different variables and the distribution is taken as an indicator whether or not the variables are normalized in the course of logarithmizing. In that regard, additional variables are created with the given and outside data to potentially enrich the analysis. After that, analyzing the correlation of potential independent variables with the dependent variables provides a first inside as to what is expected for the regression. Lastly, the regression is run with various models to optimize the model fit. As a result, the findings are converted into action-oriented recommendations for Airbnb and individual homeowners to maximize profits and implementation notes.","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"cd78124b-b3da-4af0-a4c6-ffac7badbb98","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"ec6e6ca2-94b6-450f-ad47-99a6794243a6","deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"# Disclaimer: Running the entire notebook at once is time consuming as the distance calculations entail \n# millions of individual equations.

we decided to experiment with different setups, ranging from minimally small setups with just one or two layers and equally few neurons to arbitrarily large networks. Ultimately, it seems as if a relatively large architecture yields better results, presumably given the large number of input features. The smallest RMSE we managed to achieve was 0.1635 with a setup of 15 layers and a gradually decreasing number of neurons per layer. This result, however, likely is the result of overfitting the model as this initial setup did not include a validation split. Including a validation split, the model below (model1) yielded the lowest RMSE (0.3) of the setups we experimented with. Additionally, we tried using MLPRegressor, which, however, only yielded an RMSE of around 0.37.","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"5d5d9c80-3932-4374-babf-4f61c327cf5f","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"f6dc1fd6-91b1-4074-85da-acd424386fd0","deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"import keras\nimport tensorflow","execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"5193b12b-ae0d-41d7-bd7c-1f2c2d6a1848","deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"# number of hidden layers nh = Ns/(α∗ (Ni + No))\n# Ns: samples\n# No: output neurons\n# Ni: input neurons\n# α arbitrary scaling factor\n\n\nmodel2 = keras.Sequential([\n\n    keras.layers.Dense(295, activation='relu', input_shape=(295,)),\n    \n    keras.layers.Dense(512, activation='relu'),\n    keras.layers.Dense(512, activation='relu'),\n    keras.layers.Dense(512, activation='relu'),\n    keras.layers.Dense(512, activation='relu'),\n    keras.layers.Dense(512, activation='relu'),\n    keras.layers.Dense(512, activation='relu'),\n    keras.layers.Dense(512, activation='relu'),\n    keras.layers.Dense(512, activation='relu'),\n    keras.layers.Dense(512, activation='relu'),\n    keras.layers.Dense(512, activation='relu'),\n    keras.layers.Dense(512, activation='relu'),\n    keras.layers.Dense(512, activation='relu'),\n    keras.layers.Dense(512, activation='relu'),\n    keras.layers.Dense(512, activation='relu'),\n    keras.layers.Dense(512, activation='relu'),\n    keras.layers.Dense(512, activation='relu'),\n\n    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='relu')\n\n])\n","execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"d71800e8-51ae-4a07-934b-a43b4de6945e","deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"model2.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')","execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"d4c69506-408b-47e7-9207-56a79808f586","output_cleared":true,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"# fitting Model 2 variables\n\nmodel2.fit(x_log_train, y_log_train, epochs=100, batch_size=500, validation_split=0.1, callbacks=[keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping(patience=10)])","execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"577f9c48-2b73-4bf3-8877-626e3a0ec32f","output_cleared":true,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"NN2_y_log_pred = model2.predict(x_log_test)\nrmse_NN2 = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_log_test, NN2_y_log_pred))\n\nrmse_results[(\"Neural Network\", \"Model 2\")] = rmse_NN2\n\nprint(rmse_NN2) ","execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"2ba0c5b8-7ea9-416a-9b4c-dc1a5ecadd80","output_cleared":true,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"model2.save('model2')","execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Exporting final RMSE scores to Excel","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"6d67c521-c6f4-4677-b43d-9cd277d2bd47","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"2903fe61-22e7-4cee-9c04-0930699772bb","deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"final_scores = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(rmse_results, orient='index')\nfinal_scores.to_excel(r'final_scores.xlsx')","execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Recommendations\n\nBased on the regression results, we identified several levers to positively influence the listings‘s price and therewith maximize returns of Airbnb and the homeowners. For the purpose of the challenge, the guiding principle for the selection of recommendations is profit maximization. It is needless to say that other factors such as sociability also contribute to the welfare of homeowners. Hence, factors beyond the financial impact would need to be considered despite the analysis. \n\nStarting with homeowners, the recommendation with the highest financial benefit attached to it is to offer entire homes instead of private/shared rooms only. For all machine learning algorithms, the home type was by far the most important determinant. Especially tourists seem to value more amenity and flexibility, and are willing to pay more for respective homes. Secondly, the data suggests that the superhost status has a positive impact on the price charged for a home. Hence, we recommend that homeowners should actively work towards meeting the superhost criteria. The criteria for superhosts are a rating of 4.8 or above, 10+ stays, <1% cancellation rate, and a 90% response rate. Consequently, the criterion of being a superhost implicitly accounts for further characteristics. Paying attention to a high quality standard of the offering and reviews/responses respectively, homeowners should be well-equipped to gain the superhost status. Although the analysis was limited to listings with less than 31 minimum nights, this variable is negatively correlated with the price. Reducing the minimum nights would enable homeowners to exploit the WTP of customers further. This goes hand in hand with the focus on touristic travel which usually stay in one place for less than a week (e.g. when visiting multiple cities in a short time during a road trip). Tourists are generally willing to pay a price premium for their accommodation. This surplus can be capture better when the minimum nights are reduced. \n\nFor Airbnb, we identified review rewards as the most important measure to increase customer engagement and indirectly through that also the willingness to pay of other customers that comes with a larger number of reviews. As described above, encouraging reviews has positive spillover effects via the superhost feature. Moreover, hosts are able to improve their service when they receive adequate feedback and suggestions. This in turn, improves the reputation of Airbnb as a substitute for normal hotels. The incentive scheme could, for example, entail a reduction in the fees that Airbnb charges for the stay if the visitor has a >90% review rate. While the proximity to subways did not significantly increase the price, they should introduce location-specific perks to target home owners in expensive districts. There is a variety of different possibilities for the exact perks to be included in the system. For example, Airbnb could offer a centrally organized cleaning service for the homeowners, which is cheaper than what landlords would regularly pay. As Manhatten has a high density of Airbnbs with short distances, this cleaning service would come at low organizational costs. Lastly, we recommend Airbnb to give homeowner guidance regarding a target price that incorporates all additional factors considered in this analysis. As of now, Airbnb recommends landlords a price based on what other homeowners in that neighbourhood charge. The preceded analysis showed, however, that prices are only to a very small extent rooted on the location. Instead, other characteristics like the room type, host information, and minimum nights are further relevant aspects. As an action plan, we recommend that for each new listing, Airbnb utilizes the coefficients and relative feature weights as estimated in the regressions above to indicate a realistic price based on all the information entered by the homeowner. With that, Airbnb ensures that homeowners optimize price setting based on all information available. \n\nWe want to emphasize again that these recommendations are subject to individual preferences and based entirely on the assumption of profit maximization. They do not account for the preference to host guests for a longer time or to live together with the guest for the stay.","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"def1df3e-3b42-48de-a889-e3e6d294461b","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}}],"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2,"metadata":{"orig_nbformat":2,"deepnote_notebook_id":"b869b2f7-06b7-48fe-89dd-8ac216cd1b72","deepnote_execution_queue":[]}}
